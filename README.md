# Green Tips Site

This folder contains everything you need to publish a simple random green‑tips page.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Main page that shows a random tip each load. |
| `ysj_logo.png` | **Add your official logo here**; keep the filename so it loads automatically. |

## How to publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new public repository (e.g. `green-tips`).
2. Upload **both** the `index.html` and your `ysj_logo.png`.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, source = `main` branch, folder = `/root`.
4. Hit Save. Your site will appear at `https://<username>.github.io/green-tips/`.

Enjoy!
